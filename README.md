# final-project

I'm using data from the CDC's website to examine and analyze the rate of boys and girls ages 13 to 17 that have gotten the HPV vaccination rate over the last 10 years or so.

For my project, I downloaded datasets from the CDC for each year from 2008 to 2018, which broke down the vaccination rate based on a variety of factors, including gender, age, race, etc. Each year's dataset was extremely widespread and organized the rates by state, and even some areas within a state, but I didn't need such a big set for what I was looking into in this project, especially when comparing year to year. I decided to manually copy and paste the information that I needed (overall rate based on age and gender for all U.S. states between 2008 ans 2010) into my own three csv files.

rate_by_year.csv = the years that I'm looking at (2008-2018), along with the HPV vaccination rate for girls age 13-17 and the rate for boys age 13-17, both in Missouri and the overall U.S. rate.

female_state.csv = the rate of vaccination for girls age 13-17 in each state for each year (plus the U.S. average) from 2008 to 2018. This dataset also included the 2018 combined rate for both boys and girls age 13-17 (which I may need to pull into it's own sheet so it doesn't mess up the analysis)

male_state.csv = the rate of vaccination for boys age 13-17 in each state for each year (plus the U.S. average) from 2008 to 2018. It seems like the CDC didn't collect information for boys' vaccinations until 2011, and didn't do so consistently until 2013. There isn't any info about the Missouri boys' vaccination rate until 2013.
